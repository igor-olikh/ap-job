# Moving from Project Management to Product Management (PM)

Moving from Project Management to Product Management (PM) is one of the most natural transitions in the tech world. While they are distinct roles, they share the same "connective tissue."

Here is an analysis of her situation and how to bridge that experience gap:

## The Reality of the Transition

The biggest hurdle isn't a lack of skill; it’s a shift in mindset.

- **Project Management** is about the "When" and "How": Execution, timelines, resources, and risk mitigation.
- **Product Management** is about the "What" and "Why": Market fit, user pain points, ROI, and vision.

Since she already has an MBA and 5+ years of experience in gaming and e-commerce, she isn't starting from zero. She has "indirect experience" in high-pressure, data-heavy environments.

## Why She Is Better Positioned Than She Thinks

She can leverage several "transferable pillars" to prove she can do the job:

- **Stakeholder Management**: She already knows how to navigate conflicting interests between developers, marketing, and executives. This is 50% of a PM's job.
- **Technical Literacy**: Her experience with billing, authentication, and CRM systems means she can speak "Engineer." A PM who understands technical constraints is highly valued.
- **The MBA Foundation**: An MBA provides the frameworks needed for the business side of PM (market analysis, unit economics, and strategy).

## My Opinion: How to Close the Gap

To land a PM role without "official" title experience, I recommend she focuses on these three areas:

1. **Lead with Data**: In her current or past projects, she should find instances where she didn't just manage the task, but influenced the outcome based on data. (e.g., "Identified a drop-off in the billing flow and proposed a UX change that increased conversion by 5%"). That is PM work.
2. **Productize the Gaming Experience**: Gaming is incredibly data-driven (DAU, MAU, Retention, Monetization). She should stop describing herself as someone who "delivered games" and start describing herself as someone who "optimized user engagement and monetization flows."
3. **The "Internal" Pivot**: The easiest path is often a "stealth transition" at a current company—taking on PM responsibilities (like writing PRDs or talking to users) while officially being a Project Manager. This builds the resume naturally.

## Is it a good move?

**Yes.** Given her interest in data analysis and her background in e-commerce, moving to Product Management offers more strategic influence and generally higher long-term career growth. The "lack of experience" is a narrative hurdle, not a functional one.
